<p>I am Daniel, a student and an aspiring computer scientist/programmer. Ever since I was 10 years old I have always had a fascination with computers. This led me to taking my first computer science class in freshman year where I got to experiment with electronics and programs. Now I am 16 years old and taking multiple computer focused classes with the goal to get into a college with a good computer science course.
